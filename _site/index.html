        <p>A shared library containing steps and utilities that are required by Jenkins pipelines. The best practice pipelines are based on the general concepts of Jenkins 2.0 Pipelines as Code. With that you have the power of the Jenkins community at hand to optimize your pipelines.</p>
        <p>This library should be already configured in your jenkins tenant instance ([try this to check if it is working](check-library)),
 so you just have to reference the library at the beginning of your Jenkinsfile of your pipeline jenkins project or multi-branch jenkins projects (Branch Sources Github):

 ```groovy
    @Library('global-alm-pipeline-library') _
``` 
        </p>
        <p>This library includes a collection of steps and predefined pipelines to be used in the ALM Multicloud instances, so it expects some Jenkins plugins and slaves preconfigured. You can run the best practice Jenkins pipelines out of the box, take them as a starting point for project-specific adaptations or implement your own pipelines from scratch using the shared library.</p>

<h1><a id="api" class="anchor" href="#api" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>API</h1>
<p>All steps (vars and resources directory) are intended to be used by Pipelines and are considered API. All the classes / groovy-scripts contained in the src folder are by default not part of the API and are subjected to change without prior notice. Types and methods annotated with @API are considered to be API, used e.g. from other shared libraries. Changes to those methods/types needs to be announced, discussed and agreed.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>
<p>You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.</p>
